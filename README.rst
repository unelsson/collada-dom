Contents of COLLADA Package
===========================

The COLLADA Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) that provides a C++ object representation of a COLLADA XML instance document.

This project is a library for loading and saving COLLADA documents that can contain 2D, 3D, physics and other types of content. It allows developers 
to create applications that can exchange COLLADA documents with commercial content creation tools such as Maya, Max or Softimage.  

This project is a very lightweight version of the `Sourceforce Collada Repository <http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom/>`_. It maintains only the base collada parser with minimal dependencies.

Everything in this package can be built on any platform using CMake.  For additional information on
tools and plugins that support COLLADA, or to get help from the Internet community of COLLADA users,
please visit www.collada.org

Questions, bug reports and feature requests should go to our `GitHub site <https://github.com/rdiankov/collada-dom>`_

The binary packages only contain release builds. If you need to debug the DOM you should download
the source and build it on your machine. The Visual Studio packages include debug builds because you
can't link a release DOM into a debug app with that compiler. The debug info has been stripped
though to keep the download size down.
